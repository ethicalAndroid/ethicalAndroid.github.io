Hello everyone!

My name is **Mateo de la Rosa**, but I am known by my username **WumpleDoodle**.
I'm an indie dev from North America, specifically the U.S. state of Virginia!
I have been making games since I was a kid, and I haven't stopped since.

My first games were made in the **Scratch** programming language.
At the time, the ease of sharing Scratch games online and the ease of making them made Scratch a very appealing tool.
I made a LOT of games with Scratch.

However, I started to hit the limitations of the Scratch engine after a year or so.
At the time I was writing mods for *Binding of Isaac Rebirth* in the Lua programming language.
After some searching, I found a game framework that used Lua as its coding language: **LÖVE**.
Using LÖVE (also known as Love2D), I made my first full game: **Bombing Run**.

After completing that game, I wanted to try an actual game engine.
My engine of choice ended up being **Unity**.
I made a lot of test games in Unity, trying out different aspects of the engine, the most polished of these being **Corn Quest**.
However, after trying and failing at some experimental titles, I decided to make Bombing Run in Unity.
This project lead to my second full game: **Bombing Run 2**.
After finishing that game, I made a much smaller game called **Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament**

One great thing about learning Unity was the engine's affinity for collaboration.
In college, I participated in a lot of in-person game jams.
I have worked in 5 game jam games to date, and all but 1 of those games were made using Unity.
One of the jam games, **Dungeon Master**, was even ported to Android!

Wow! That was a lot of history.
I hope you find my journey and my games interesting!
I'll be posting more here, so stay tuned for updates!
